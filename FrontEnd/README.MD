## How to Enable HTTPS

If you want to enable an HTTPS server for local development, you can update the **Vite** configuration as follows:

1. Install Vite if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react
    ```

2. Update the \`vite.config.ts\` file to include HTTPS:

    ```typescript
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

    export default defineConfig({
    	plugins: [react()],
    	server: {
    		https: {
    			key: './localhost-key.pem', // Path to your private key
    			cert: './localhost.pem', // Path to your certificate
    		},
    	},
    });
    ```

3. Place your SSL certificate and private key in the root of your project.

4. Restart the development server to apply the changes.

## Deployment

1. Build the app for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Serve the production build using any static file server (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3).
